        I drew this artwork after returning to Nanjing from Suzhou. The 
        original picture was taken on Pingjiang Road and it was my 
        favourite picture from Suzhou. 

        This was my first major digital artwork, taking 3 days totallying 
        over 25 hours. I used skills I learned from traditional acrylic 
        painting with principles of realism and impressionism.
