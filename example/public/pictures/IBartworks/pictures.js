        Humans are constantly interacting with their emotions. Just as for me, 
        my maths-heavy, logic-based focus isn’t able to supress those emotions. 
        So, Art became an outlet. Therefore, this exhibition explores the 
        influence of the external world on one’s internal feelings, exemplified 
        through my use of portraiture. As I sunk into the stress of the IB, I 
        was inspired by Jonas Burgert’s exploration of the manipulation of time. 
        Therefore, I decided to depict the cyclical nature of stress-management, 
        suggesting that not everything in life progresses in one direction.
        <br />
        <br />
        The five artworks each represent a stage of this cycle, beginning with 
        readiness, then cowardice, acceptance, overwhelmingness, recuperation, 
        and returning to the beginning. Stained cyanotype illustrates the internal 
        because of its dreamy quality, domonstrating how no one completely 
        understands their emotions. This quality is visually set-apart from the 
        rest of the artwork, depicting the clash between reality and imagination. 
        Mixed media also allowed me to depict the complexity of those emotions.
        <br />
        <br />
        Inspired by my excitement to take the IB, my exhibition begins with Drops 
        of Chaos, where figures express confidence and readiness to take on 
        challenges. As stress and fear build up, I try to distil them with layers 
        of dreams and self-talk, shown through Flow of Imagination. In Boxes of 
        Feelings, I eventually learn to face stress, accepting that it’s a part 
        of me, as it stands with all of my other emotions. This acceptance crumbles, 
        depicted in Sweeps of Frustration, when I experienced burn-outs at the 
        start of 12th grade. To recuperate, I decided to take a break from my 
        studies, inspiring me to illustrate myself in nature in Pieces of 
        Relaxation. The acrylic painting in my last artwork refers back to the 
        first painting, guiding the viewer back to the beginning.

        The arrangement of the artworks illustrates this cycle. The first stage 
        of the cycle, Dripping Chaos, is placed on the top, while the position 
        of the rationale and artist-statements guide the viewer’s eyes through 
        the artworks like reading a clock, further connecting to the theme of 
        time. The L-shaped Sweeps of Frustration is perfect for being positioned 
        at the corner, connecting to Boxes of Feelings while directing the viewer 
        up to the last artwork. Since the last artwork is the largest, I placed 
        it on top, more strongly hinting that the journey cycles back to the 
        first artwork, as the viewer looks from left to right, big to small.

        The idea of this artwork is finding friends in this chaotic world. 
        The background’s overwhelming qualities show the internal turmoils of 
        the two figures, and the monochromatic colour scheme differentiates the 
        internal and the external. The two figures in the foreground are hugging, 
        looking in different directions. This can be interpreted in two ways. 
        The pessimistic interpretation would be that they pretend to be friends 
        but are actually two different people on the inside, both unable to 
        express their true feelings to the other (presented by the silhouette 
        of the leaves - symbolising a cover-up of the figures’ inner feelings). 
        The optimistic interpretation would be finding someone who always supports 
        you in the overwhelming society, despite being completely different. The 
        colour choice of their clothes emphasises their differences as they are 
        contrasting colours of black and white. The mixture of media and the 
        unfinished qualities, especially along the edges of the painting, also 
        tie in with the concept of distortion.

        The idea of this artwork is using imagination to isolate me from the outside 
        world along with the emotions evoked by it (eg. fear, sadness). As inspired 
        by Alyssa Monks, the artwork depicts me in my most vulnerable state: when 
        I sleep. Often times complex emotions arise, which may lead me to sweat or 
        tear, keeping me from falling asleep (this can be seen in the clenching of my 
        blanket on the right side of my artwork). To escape from those emotions, I 
        distance myself from the real world by putting myself in an imaginary land, 
        which keeps me comfortable and relaxed. The cyanotype, along with the wine 
        and tee stains, symbolises that of my inner world, my imagination, which 
        takes in the form of a scarf covering my eyes. This enables my imagination 
        to overpower my senses in the real world, allowing myself to escape from it. 
        As its colours are a great contrast from the rest of the artwork, it shows 
        that at that state, my mind is no longer present in the real world, which 
        only has a black and white colour scheme.

        Boxes of different feelings have different sizes corresponding to the 
        prominence of those feelings. They are stacked on one another in the 
        order of least to more desirable. Stress is mostly caused by my urge 
        to achieve perfection, yet un-motivation still plagues me as I fail 
        to clean up my mess. Climbing up the ladder of growth becomes harder 
        though it means greater achievements, yet the decisions made during 
        growth tear me apart. Relaxation is the best, but the least prominent 
        of all emotions.

        Louise Nevelson and Joseph Cornell are my inspirations for this artwork. 
        Five boxes of different feelings are of different sizes, representing the 
        prominence of those feelings. They are stacked on one another in the 
        order of least to more desirable.

        Amidst the chaos, would there be a source of tranquillity, emanating 
        and reflecting sunshine to all corners of the room? Inspired by Frank 
        Auerbach, the artwork uses the contrast between rough and smooth 
        textures to show the contrast between chaos and serenity and emphasise 
        one’s facial expressions. The coffee-stained background further muddles 
        the concoction of the irritating mess in the background. However, in 
        the foreground, there exists a cyanotype reed, symbolising the whisk 
        from Daoism that sweeps away “bad qi”. The reed is partially illustrated 
        with cyanotype, a media I use to represent my inner world. But must 
        I seek for this calmness within me by myself? Or could it be found 
        everywhere in the mundane world, just like the ubiquitous reed?

        Inspired by Claude Monet and Kiki’s Delivery Service from Studio 
        Ghibli, this last exhibition piece serves as an end to my journey in 
        learning to deal with stress and chaos. It shows me becoming a part of 
        nature, relaxing and recuperating from the chaotic life. The artwork 
        is constructed with multiple pieces, connecting to the idea of 
        gathering myself back together. The piece is, therefore, an open ending, 
        suggesting that the journey never ends and will likely cycle back to the 
        beginning, which is why I chose acrylic for the tree, connecting to my 
        first artwork. The direction I am facing is more colourful than the rest, 
        bringing about a more hopeful note for the otherwise “anti-climatic” end.

        The artworks are inspired by the collage artist Adam Hale and they 
        connect together by the same theme. Pages from a romance novel represent 
        love, which in this case, means our love for nature. The coffee stains, 
        therefore, mean the forgetting of this love. The artworks display the 
        flowing of time. Cuts of Forgetfulness shows that, as we forget about 
        our love for nature, the beauty of nature and nature itself (represented 
        by the butterfly) will eventually be forgotten as well. Lost and 
        Forgetfulness has a similar story. With blank pages of the romance 
        novel occupying his head, he has no love for nature. He only looks at 
        a piece of land with the ambition of exploiting it. This causes him to 
        forget about the beauty of the piece of the land itself and the natural 
        habitat that lives there. As he forgets everything, nature disappears 
        with it, just as represented by the black and white that covers the 
        butterflies’ wings.
