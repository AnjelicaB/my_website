        Hello! My name is Anjelica. 
        <br />
        <br />
        I am a rising sophomore at Cornell University, and I plan on studying 
        Electrical and Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer Science and
        either maths or data science. 
        <br />
        <br />
        I am in our school's robotics lab called the EmPRISE Robotics Lab, and 
        I am in a professional business fraternity called Phi Chi Theta. That said, 
        my professional interests lie at the intersection between technology and 
        business. Beyond software engineering, I am also interested in consulting.
        <br />
        <br />
        Outside of my academic and professional careers, I am an avid artist and 
        I love trying out new things. I've explored the Cornell 
        Rowing Club, Origami Club, some naturalist clubs and I'm looking to 
        exploring more!
        <br />
        I created this website to document my interests outside of school. Feel free
        to reach out at yb265@cornell.edu.
        </p>
