//         <p>
//         The idea of this artwork is finding friends in this chaotic world. 
//         The background’s overwhelming qualities show the internal turmoils of 
//         the two figures, and the monochromatic colour scheme differentiates the 
//         internal and the external. The two figures in the foreground are hugging, 
//         looking in different directions. This can be interpreted in two ways. 
//         The pessimistic interpretation would be that they pretend to be friends 
//         but are actually two different people on the inside, both unable to 
//         express their true feelings to the other (presented by the silhouette 
//         of the leaves - symbolising a cover-up of the figures’ inner feelings). 
//         The optimistic interpretation would be finding someone who always supports 
//         you in the overwhelming society, despite being completely different. The 
//         colour choice of their clothes emphasises their differences as they are 
//         contrasting colours of black and white. The mixture of media and the 
//         unfinished qualities, especially along the edges of the painting, also 
//         tie in with the concept of distortion.
